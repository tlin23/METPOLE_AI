## âœ… Manual Testing Checklist

Before production deployment, verify:

### Security:

- [x] Database admin interface requires authentication
- [x] Non-admin users cannot access admin endpoints
- [x] OAuth flow works correctly (manual browser testing completed)
- [x] CORS properly configured for production
- [x] HTTPS enforced in production (via fly.toml force_https=true)
- [x] Security headers present
- [x] Error messages don't leak sensitive information

### Performance:

- [x] System handles expected concurrent load
- [x] Response times within acceptable limits
- [x] No memory leaks under sustained load
- [x] Graceful degradation under extreme load

### Functionality:

- [ ] All API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Database operations work under load
- [ ] File uploads/downloads work (if applicable)
- [ ] Error handling works as expected

### Monitoring:

- [x] Error logging works properly
- [x] Performance metrics collected
- [ ] Alerts configured for critical issues (not applicable in dev)
- [ ] Log rotation configured (not applicable in dev)

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Database Admin Not Protected:

1. Check nginx configuration
2. Verify .htpasswd file exists and is mounted
3. Test nginx config: `nginx -t`
4. Restart nginx service

### OAuth Flow Failing:

1. Verify Google OAuth credentials
2. Check redirect URIs match configuration
3. Inspect browser network tab for errors
4. Verify CORS settings

### Performance Issues:

1. Check database query performance
2. Monitor memory usage
3. Verify connection pooling
4. Check for N+1 query problems

### Rate Limiting Not Working:

1. Verify rate limiting middleware configured
2. Check Redis/memory store for rate limiting
3. Test with multiple IP addresses
4. Verify rate limiting headers in response
