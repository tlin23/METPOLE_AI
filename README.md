# METPOLE_AI

A project for crawling, processing, and retrieving content from the Metropole Ballard website. The application includes a FastAPI backend and a React frontend.

## üìã Components

- **Crawler**: Fetches and processes web content
- **Chunking**: Breaks content into manageable chunks
- **Embedding**: Converts text to vector embeddings
- **Retrieval**: Queries the vector store and generates answers using LLM

## üîß Setup

1. Clone the repo and navigate to the folder:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/METPOLE_AI.git
   cd METPOLE_AI
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file:

   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   CHROMA_DB_PATH=./data/index
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   ```

## üóÑÔ∏è Vector Store

The project uses Chroma as a persistent vector store for embeddings. The vector store is initialized at `./data/index` by default, but this can be changed in the `.env` file.

To initialize the vector store:

```bash
python -m app.vector_store.init_chroma
```

To run a demo of the vector store:

```bash
python -m app.vector_store.demo
```

### Git Index Management

The project includes a script to manage which Chroma index directories are tracked by Git. By default, only the latest index directory is tracked, which helps keep the repository size manageable.

The script automatically:

1. Identifies the most recently modified index directory
2. Updates the `.gitignore` file to exclude all other index directories
3. Ensures the `chroma.sqlite3` file is always tracked

To manually update which index is tracked:

```bash
python update_git_index.py
```

This script is also configured as a pre-commit hook, so it runs automatically before each commit to ensure only the latest index is tracked.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the app

### Local Development

Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Docker

You can also run the application using Docker:

```bash
# Build and start the containers
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop the containers
docker-compose down
```

The API will be available at http://localhost:8000.

#### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```

These variables will be automatically loaded by docker-compose.

## üß™ Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite covering all components:

```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-cov

# Run all tests
./run_tests.py

# Run with coverage report
./run_tests.py -c

# Run specific test categories
./run_tests.py -m unit
./run_tests.py -m integration
./run_tests.py -m crawler
./run_tests.py -m embedding
./run_tests.py -m retrieval
./run_tests.py -m edge_case

# Run tests with verbose output
./run_tests.py -v
```

For more details on the test suite, see [tests/README.md](tests/README.md).

## üöÄ Deployment

The application can be deployed to cloud services using the provided configuration files. For detailed deployment instructions, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).

### Deployment Options

1. **Render.com (Recommended)**

   - Backend: Docker-based web service
   - Frontend: Static site
   - Configuration: `render.yaml`

2. **Fly.io + Render**
   - Backend: Fly.io with Docker
   - Frontend: Render static site
   - Configuration: `fly.toml` for backend, frontend deployed separately

### Testing Deployment

After deployment, you can test the end-to-end flow using the provided test script:

```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the test script
./test_deployment.py --backend-url https://metpol-ai-backend.onrender.com
```

The test script verifies:

- Backend API connectivity
- Crawling functionality
- Querying and asking questions
- Source display
- Feedback logging

### CI/CD

The repository includes GitHub Actions workflows for continuous deployment:

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: Deploys both backend and frontend to Render
